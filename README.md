# Road Sign Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

In this project, we will explore the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for road sign recognition. CNNs are a type of deep learning model that have proven to be highly effective in image classification tasks.

## Dataset

We will be using the **GTSRB (German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark)** dataset, which consists of thousands of labeled images of road signs. The dataset contains various types of road signs, including speed limits, stop signs, yield signs, and more.

## Model Architecture

Our CNN model will have the following architecture:

- Input Layer: Accepts input images of a fixed size.
- Convolutional Layers: Apply convolutional filters to extract meaningful features from the input images.
- Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps to capture important patterns at different scales.
- Fully Connected Layers: Process the features and make predictions for the different road sign classes.
- Output Layer: Produces the final predicted probabilities for each road sign class.

## Training

We will train our CNN model using the labeled images from the GTSRB dataset. The training process involves the following steps:

1. Preprocess the images: Resize the images to a fixed size and apply any necessary normalization or augmentation techniques.
2. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets.
3. Model Training: Train the CNN model on the training set using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.
4. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance on the validation set and make any necessary adjustments to improve performance.
5. Testing: Finally, test the trained model on the unseen testing set to assess its generalization capabilities.

## Results and Conclusion

After training and testing our CNN model on the road sign recognition task, we will analyze the results and draw conclusions. We will evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics to assess its performance. Additionally, we may discuss possible improvements or future directions for the project.

## Conclusion

In this project, we explored the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for road sign recognition. By training a CNN model on the GTSRB dataset, we achieved promising results in classifying different types of road signs. The CNN architecture, along with proper training and evaluation techniques, proved effective in this image classification task.
